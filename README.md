ABOUT PLUGIN: 
  It provides 2fa via telegram bot. That's not a bungeecord plugin, it works only on spigot servers. I didn't test plugin too much so it may have any bugs/errors. 
  If you found one - please contact me and describe the issue. It's my first repository so i know it's pretty bad, maybe i will make a video instruction later ;)



REQUIREMENTS:
  1. Telegram bot. Here is the instruction how to create one: https://www.sohamkamani.com/blog/2016/09/21/making-a-telegram-bot/ 
  2. Java 8. It was compiled on java 8 so it MAY NOT work on java 8+
  3. Minecraft version from 1.8.8 to 1.16.5. It MAY work on 1.17, but there is no guaranty



INSTRUCTION:
  1. Go to the release's folder and download the latest version
  2. Stop your minecraft server
  3. Drag .jar file right to the plugin's folder
  4. Start yout server
  5. Your console is red. It's ok, just stop your server again
  6. Create new telegram bot. Here is the instruction: https://www.sohamkamani.com/blog/2016/09/21/making-a-telegram-bot/ 
  7. Open config.yml and add your bot's token and username (token and user_name fields)
  8. Also you need to connect this plugin to the database. It uses mysql. So you need to add your database's data (MySql field)
  9. Swear to God (it helps)
  10. Start your server
  11. There we go! I hope it's working for you ;)
